        I have around 5 years of professional experience in different fields of Information Technology (such as-Web application development, system architecture, server administration, and database management), that I have gained in diverse industries, such as- software development, tourism, and banking. I am fluent in English and have a beginner level of proficiency in German. I am perceived as an energetic and committed person. I am currently working with Cloud computing, Data Analytics, and writing reusable codes for web based applications. I have worked for 4 years with ISO-8583 financial messaging standards. I have also worked for POS, ATM and E-Commerce certifications, and implementing financial mandates for IT security compliances, which were mostly governed by the global payment systems (American Express, VISA & MasterCard).

          > My most favorite things to do during my free times, are outdoor activities like- running, cycling, CrossFit, or swimming. I am an amateur athlete by passion, who also believes in competitive racing as a medium of self-development. 
        </br>  > I am part of an active lifestyle platform, where we provide free bodyweight exercise and train with the people, who want to be fit and healthy. 
        </br>  > Once upon a time, I used to love writing and I wanted to pursue a career in it. But unfortunately, I was never good enough for that, and eventually, I had to drop that. 
        </br>  > I remember I was very afraid of maths until my teenage. In college, I met a math professor, who was very patient and generous to help me to discover the unseen, wonderful world of mathematics. And, along with many other areas in my life, that has greatly helped me to easily adopt new logic, algorithm and data structures in coding.
        </br>  > Currently, I am training to finish my maiden marathon strongly with sub 3hr 45mins timing. The timing is merely a target, I rather want to enjoy the process.
